1.1 SCOPE
This document describes the preferred, acceptable, and non-
conforming conditions that are either externally or internally
observable on printed boards. It represents the visual interpre-
tation of minimum requirements set forth in various printed
board specifications, i.e.; IPC-6010 series, ANSI/J-STD-003,
etc.
1.2 PURPOSE
The visual illustrations in this document portray specific crite-
ria of the requirements of current IPC specifications. In order
to properly apply and use the content of this document, the
printed wiring product should comply with the design require-
ments of the applicable IPC-2220 series document and the
performance requirements of the applicable IPC-6010 series
document. In the event the printed wiring product does not
comply with these or equivalent requirements, then the
acceptance criteria should be as defined between a user and
supplier agreement as part of the procurement documenta-
tion.
The illustrations in this document portray specific criteria relat-
ing to the heading and subheading of each page, with brief
descriptions of the acceptable and nonconforming conditions
for each product class. (See 1.4 Classification.) The visual
quality acceptance criteria are intended to provide proper
tools for the evaluation of visual anomalies. The illustrations
and photographs in each situation are related to specific
requirements. The characteristics addressed are those that
can be evaluated by visual observation and/or measurement
of visually observable features.
Supported by appropriate user requirements, this document
should provide effective visual criteria to quality assurance and
manufacturing personnel.
This document cannot cover all of the reliability concerns
encountered in the printed board industry; therefore,
attributes not addressed in this issue shall be agreed upon
between user and supplier. The value of this document lies in
its use as a baseline document that may be modified by
expansions, exceptions, and variations which may be appro-
priate for specific applications.
This is a document for minimum acceptability requirements
and is not intended to be used as a performance specification
for printed board manufacture or procurement.
In the event of a conflict between the requirements of this
document and the applicable product performance specifica-
tion, the following precedence shall be used:
a) Approved Printed Board Procurement Document
b) Generic Specifications
c) Applicable Performance Specification
d) Acceptability of Printed Boards (IPC-A-600)
When making accept and/or reject decisions, the awareness
of documentation precedence must be maintained.
This document is a tool for observing how a product may
deviate due to variation in processes. Refer to IPC-9191.
IPC-A-600 provides a useful tool for understanding and inter-
pretating Automated Inspection Technology (AIT) results. AIT
may be applicable to the evaluation of many of the dimen-
sional characteristics illustrated in this document.
1.3 APPROACH TO THIS DOCUMENT
Characteristics are divided into two general groups:
• Externally Observable (Section 2)
• Internally Observable (Section 3)
‘‘Externally observable’’ conditions are those features or
imperfections which can be seen and evaluated on or from
the exterior surface of the board. In some cases, such as
voids or blisters, the actual condition is an internal phenom-
enon and is detectable from the exterior.
‘‘Internally observable’’ conditions are those features or
imperfections that require microsectioning of the specimen or
other forms of conditioning for detection and evaluation. In
some cases, these features may be visible from the exterior
and require microsectioning in order to assess acceptability
requirements.
Specimens should be illuminated during evaluation to the
extent needed for effective examination. The illumination
should be such that no shadow falls on the area of interest
except those shadows caused by the specimen itself. It is
recommended that polarization and/or dark field illumination
be employed to prevent glare during the examination of highly
reflective materials.
1.4 CLASSIFICATION
This document recognizes that the acceptable extent of
imperfection for specific characteristics of printed boards may
be determined by the intended end use. For this reason, three
general classes have been established based on functional
reliability and performance requirements.
Class 1 — General Electronic products: Includes consumer
products, some computer and computer peripherals suitable
for applications where cosmetic imperfections are not impor-
tant, and the major requirement is function of the completed
printed board.
Class 2 — Dedicated Service Electronic Products: Includes
communications equipment, sophisticated business
machines, and instruments where high performance and
1.0 INTRODUCTION
Introduction
1IPC-A-600G July 2004
extended life is required, and for which uninterrupted service
is desired, but is not critical. Certain cosmetic imperfections
are allowed.
Class 3 — High Reliability Electronics Products: Includes
equipment and products where continued performance or
performance on demand is critical. Equipment downtime can-
not be tolerated, and the equipment must function when
required, such as life support systems or flight control sys-
tems. Printed boards in this class are suitable for applications
where high levels of assurance are required and service is
essential.
Acceptability criteria in this document have been separated so
that printed board product may be evaluated to any one of the
three classes. The use of one class for a specific characteris-
tic does not mean that all other characteristics must meet the
same class. Selection should be based on minimum need.
The customer has the ultimate responsibility for identifying the
class to which the product is evaluated. Thus, accept and/or
reject decisions must be based on applicable documentation
such as contracts, procurement documentation, specifica-
tions, standards and reference documents.
Requirement exceptions commonly used for industry seg-
ments such as Space and Military Avionics are described
within Performance Specification Sheets in IPC-6012 and are
designated as Class 3/A, Class 3/B, etc. The scope of IPC-A-
600 does not include illustrations for these requirement
exceptions and the user is encouraged to substitute text in
IPC-A-600 with the requirements for these Performance
Specification Sheets where applicable based on the corre-
sponding subsection in IPC-6012.
1.5 ACCEPTANCE CRITERIA
Most of the illustrations and photographs included in this
document represent three levels of quality for each specific
characteristic; i.e., Target Condition, Acceptable and Noncon-
forming. The text included with each level establishes the
‘‘Acceptance Criteria’’ for each class of product.
Target Condition depicts the desired condition. This condi-
tion may not be necessary to ensure the reliability of the board
in its service environment.
Acceptable indicates that the condition depicted, while not
necessarily perfect, will maintain the integrity and reliability of
the board in its service environment. The acceptable condition
is considered acceptable for at least one or more classes but
may not be acceptable for all classes, as specified by the
associated acceptance criteria.
Nonconforming indicates that the condition depicted may
be insufficient to ensure the reliability of the board in its service
environment. The nonconforming condition is considered
unacceptable for at least one or more classes of product but
may be acceptable for other classes as specified by the asso-
ciated acceptance criteria.
The target, acceptable and nonconforming conditions
depicted herein and the associated acceptance criteria are
intended to represent typical industrial practices. Require-
ments of individual product designs may deviate from these
criteria.
The examples shown in the photographs and/or illustrations
are sometimes exaggerated to make the referenced imperfec-
tion more apparent. The relationship between the text and the
examples is not always parallel; it would be difficult to find
many cases so specific that they would always match the
acceptance criteria. When photographs or illustrations con-
tained in this standard are not consistent with discussion in
the written Text, the written text takes precedence and should
be followed.
It should also be noted that some of the photographs used
may have more than one type of condition on the same
example. It is necessary that the users of this document pay
particular attention to the subject of each section to avoid
misinterpretation.
It should be understood that the first inference to nonconfor-
mance given implies that all other conditions of lesser magni-
tude are acceptable. Thus, a criteria which states a noncon-
formance condition as 50% of the surface is pitted, for
example, implies that anything less than 50% of the surface
being pitted is acceptable for that characteristic in that class.
Obviously, nonconformance in Class 1 implies nonconfor-
mance in Classes 2 and 3; and likewise, nonconformance for
Class 2 implies nonconformance in Class 3.
An inspector shall not make the selection as to which class
the part under inspection belongs. When making accept
and/or nonconformance decisions, the awareness of prece-
dence of documentation must be maintained, i.e., typically
contract, procurement documentation, specifications and ref-
erenced documents.
In all cases, documentation should be available to the inspec-
tor defining to which class the part submitted for inspection
belongs.
Procedures and requirements for conducting visual inspec-
tions related to this document shall be in accordance with the
requirements of the applicable performance specification.
ln the event of conflict, the following order of precedence
shall apply:
1. Procurement documentation.
2. Procurement documentation reflecting the customers
detailed requirements.
1.0 INTRODUCTION
Introduction (cont.)
2 IPC-A-600GJuly 2004
3. Other documents to the extent specified by the customer.
4. The end item performance specification such as the IPC-
6010 series when invoked by the customer.
5. This acceptability document.
Printed boards should be of uniform quality and shall con-
form to the IPC-6010 series.
IPC-6010 series establishes the minimum acceptability
requirements for printed boards. This document, IPC-A-600,
is a companion and complementary document, providing pic-
torial interpretation of these requirements.
IPC-A-600 can be used as a support document for inspec-
tion. It does not specify frequency of in-process inspection or
frequency of end product inspection. Nor is the allowable
number of nonconforming process indicators or the number
of allowable repair/rework of defects specified.
Visual examination for applicable attributes shall be con-
ducted at 3 diopters (approximately 1.75X). If the acceptable
condition of a suspected defect is not apparent, it should be
verified at progressively higher magnifications (up to 40X) to
confirm that it is a defect. Dimensional requirements such as
spacing or conductor width measurements may require other
magnifications and devices with reticles or scales in the instru-
ment, which allow accurate measurements of the specified
dimensions. Contract or specification may require other mag-
nifications.
Plated-through holes shall be internally examined for foil and
plating integrity at a magnification of 100X. Referee examina-
tions shall be accomplished at a magnification of 200X.
Automated Inspection Technology (AIT) results may be appli-
cable to the evaluation of many of the dimensional character-
istics illustrated in this document.
1.6 APPLICABLE DOCUMENTS 1
The following documents form a part of this document to the

Introduction (cont.)
3IPC-A-600G July 2004
This section addresses those characteristics which are observable from the surface. This includes those characteristics that are
external and internal in the printed board but visible from the surface as follows:
• Surface Imperfections such as burrs, nicks, scratches, gouges, cut fibers, weave exposure and voids.
• Subsurface Imperfections such as foreign inclusions, measling/crazing, delamination, pink ring and laminate voids.
• Imperfections in Conductive Pattern such as loss of adhesion, reduction of conductor width or thickness due to nicks, pin-
holes, scratches, surface plating or coating defects.
• Hole Characteristics such as diameter, misregistration, foreign material, and plating or coating defects.
• Marking Anomalies including location, size, readability, and accuracy.
• Solder Resist Surface Coating Imperfections such as misregistration, blisters, bubbles, delamination, adhesion, physical
damage and thickness.
• Dimensional Characteristics including printed board size and thickness, hole size and pattern accuracy, conductor width and
spacing, registration and annular ring.
2.1 Board Edges
Imperfections such as burrs, nicks or haloing along the edge of the board are acceptable provided they do not exceed the limits
below.
2.1.1 Burrs

Requirements are established through minimum internal annular ring (see 3.3.1).
3.1 DIELECTRIC MATERIAL
3.1.2 Registration/Conductors to Holes
58 IPC-A-600GJuly 2004
Visual observations made on cross-sections only.
This section covers acceptability requirements for printed board etching, innerlayers, and impedance controlled products. An
acceptable etching process must result in all residual metal being removed with no evidence of contamination remaining on the
product.
Over etching is cause for rejection when potential slivers result from excessive overhang of metal resist plating or when the fin-
ished conductor widths are less than specification requirements.
Under etching is cause for rejection when spurious metal remains on the product to the extent that spacing between conductors
is less than specification requirements or if conductor width requirements are exceeded.
Conductor width is defined as the observable width of the copper conductor excluding organic or metallic resists unless otherwise
specified. The ‘‘Minimum Conductor Width’’ often specified on the procurement documentation or performance document is usu-
ally measured at the base of the conductor and may not be the actual narrowest width of the conductor when observed in cross-
section or often when viewed from the surface. An observation from the surface may not be adequate for acceptance of some
products and etching processes. Where resistance per unit length is a requirement, a measurement of the average width of the
cross-sectional area may be necessary. Where impedance control is required, a determination of the maximum conductor width
may be important for the calculating impedance and a cross-section is often required.
Considerable variation in etch configurations is possible due to different etchants, resists and plated metal thicknesses. The con-
ductor width may increase or decrease from the production artwork due to techniques used in processing during the imaging and
developing operations. To achieve the ‘‘Design Width of Conductor,’’ the production master artwork often has conductor width
adjustments made during plotting. The amount of adjustment of a conductor width on the ‘‘Production Master’’ may be 0.025
mm to 0.05 mm [0.000984 in to 0.0020 in]. Determination of adjustment is made by experimentation and compensation for an
increase or decrease of the conductor width during plating or etching.
The illustrations in 3.2.1 are intended as a guideline to illustrate some of the edge geometry conditions which may result from dif-
ferent processing methods and illustrate the configurations of ‘‘Outgrowth,’’ ‘‘Undercut’’ and ‘‘Overhang.’’
Definitions used in evaluating etched conditions (see IPC-T-50):
Outgrowth: The increase in conductor width at one side of the conductor, caused by plating buildup over that delineated by the
production master.
Undercut: The distance on one edge of the conductor measured parallel to the board surface from the outer edge of the con-
ductor, including etch resists, to the maximum point indentation to the copper conductor.
Overhang: The sum of the outgrowth and undercut.
Design width of conductor: The width of a conductor as delineated or noted on the procurement documentation.
Notes: 1. The ‘‘Production Master’’ may be adjusted for process methods and the artwork conductor width may differ from the
design width.
2. Design width of conductor is most often stated as a minimum as measured at the base of the conductor. For imped-
ance controlled circuits, a ± tolerance may be placed on conductor width.
Production Master: A 1 to 1 scale pattern which is used to produce one or more printed boards within the accuracy specified
on the Procurement Documentation.
Etch Factor: The ratio of the depth of etch to the amount of lateral etch.

Visual observations made on cross-sections only.
This section identifies the acceptability characteristics in plated-through holes used in double-sided and multilayer rigid printed
boards. Included in this section are photographic and illustrative depictions of plated-through hole characteristics for both drilled
and punched holes, with separate examples where appropriate.
The test specimen shall be a representative coupon such as described in IPC-2221, a portion of the printed wiring board being
tested, or a whole board if within size limits.
Sample holes should be selected at random. Vertical microsections, both parallel and perpendicular to a board edge are recom-
mended. Horizontal microsectioning techniques may be used as the referee. Precise encapsulation and metallurgical techniques
must be used to assure highly polished sections with correct part alignment and polishing to the mean of the hole diameter. The
polished surface should be etched after initial smear evaluation and just prior to plating thickness measurements.
The evaluation of all properties and requirements shall be performed on the thermally stressed test coupon and all requirements
must be met; however, per supplier election, certain properties and conditions which are not affected by thermal stressing may be
evaluated in a test coupon(s) that has not been thermally stressed.
a) When a supplier elects to evaluate the unstressed test coupon for the properties in (b), he may do so at any operation follow-
ing the copper plating operation. If the board undergoes additional thermal excursions above the Tg (glass transition tempera-
ture) after copper plating, the unstressed test coupon being evaluated shall also be subjected to these thermal excursions.
b) The properties which are not affected by thermal stress include but are not limited to: copper voids, plating folds/inclusions,
burrs and nodules, glass fiber protrusion, wicking, final coating plating voids, etchback, negative etchback, plating/coating
thickness, internal and surface copper layer or foil thickness.
Methods of Inspection:
• Hole Size (method optional - IPC-TM-650, Method 2.2.7)
A. Optical
B. Document drill blank plug or plug gages
C. Tapered hole gageNote: hole gages must be cleaned and storage oil must be removed prior to use.
• Visual hole wall quality
A. Voids, Nodules, etc., - locate with unaided eye, use up to 10X magnification for verification.
B. Discolorations, Stains, etc., - use unaided eye and/or solderability tests.
3.3 PLATED-THROUGH HOLES − GENERAL
Introduction
73IPC-A-600G July 2004
Microsection:
• Plating thickness measurements
A. Encapsulated Microsection Examination (IPC-TM-650, Method 2.1.1 or Method 2.1.1.2): The average copper thickness
should be determined from three measurements, approximately equally spaced, on each side of the plated-through hole. Do
not measure in areas having isolated imperfections such as voids, cracks or nodules. Variations in cracks can be defined per
the illustration below. Small localized areas with plating thickness less than minimum requirement are evaluated as voids.
B. Nondestructive Method: Micro-ohm Measurements (IPC-TM-650, Method 2.2.13.1): This technique may be used to measure
the average copper thickness in plated-through holes when properly standardized. The method has application to measure-
ment of the minimum copper thickness. Due to the dependence on uniform hole geometry this method may not be appro-
priate for measurement of punched plated-through holes. The nondestructive feature and the speed and ease of measure-
ment make this method useful in providing variable data for statistical process control.
C. Plating Thickness: Minimum requirements are established in IPC-6010 series.
• Solderability
A lot sample or representative specimen should be subjected to a solderability test utilizing Methods B, C, or D of ANSI/
J-STD-003. The coating durability requirement should be pre-established. The plated-through holes should exhibit good wetting
and capillary action.

Visual observations made on cross-sections only.
For multilayer boards, in addition to physical measurements of board surfaces, if internal annular ring breakout is detected in the
vertical cross section, but the degree of breakout cannot be determined, internal registration may be assessed by nondestructive
techniques other than microsection, such as, special patterns, probes, and/or software, which are configured to provide informa-
tion on the interpolated annual ring remaining and pattern skew. Techniques include, but are not limited to the following:
• The optional F coupon detailed in IPC-2221.
• Custom designed electrically testable coupons.
• Radiographic (x-ray) techniques.
• Horizontal microsection.
• CAD/CAM data analysis as correlated to pattern skew by layer.Note: Microsectioning or statistical sampling shall be used to verify correlation of the approved technique, and a calibration stan-
dard established for the specific technique employed.
If misregistration to the point of breakout is detected in vertical microsections, the concerns are that:
1. The conductor width minimum may be compromised at the land junction and,
2. There is insufficient electrical spacing.
The extent and direction of breakout shall be determined. Appropriate test coupons such as those described in IPC-2221 or
actual production boards shall be tested at the affected area(s) and analyzed on the suspect layer(s) to determine compliance.
This may be accomplished by the techniques listed above.

This section provides acceptability criteria for several special printed board types. The distinctive features of these special board
types require supplementing the general acceptability criteria. For each special board type, this section outlines where and how
the general acceptability criteria are supplemented. The special board types are:
• Flexible
• Rigid-Flex
• Metal Core
• Flush
4.1 FLEXIBLE AND RIGID-FLEX PRINTED WIRING
Introduction
This section covers the acceptability requirements specific to flexible and rigid-flex printed wiring. Parameters not covered in this
section are to be evaluated using the other sections of this document.
The numeric type designator for flexible and rigid-flex printed wiring differs from that of rigid printed boards. The various types for
flexible and rigid-flex printed wiring are defined as follows:
Type 1. Single-sided flexible wiring containing one conductive layer with or without stiffeners.
Type 2. Double-sided flexible printed wiring containing two conductive layers with plated-through holes with or without stiff-
eners.
Type 3. Multilayer flexible printed wiring containing three or more conductive layers with plated-through holes with or with-
out stiffeners.
Type 4. Multilayer rigid and flexible material combinations containing three or more coonductive layers with plated-through
holes.
Type 5. Flexible or Rigid-Flex printed wiring containing two or more conductive layers without plated-through holes.
The types referred to in this section on flexible and rigid-flex printed wiring will use the definitions above.
The physical requirements for Folding Flexibility and Flexibility Endurance are not described in this document. If required by the
procurement documentation, refer to IPC-6013 for details.
